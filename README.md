# useReducer Bank Account App

This React app simulates a basic bank account using the useReducer hook to manage state transitions like opening an account, depositing, withdrawing, requesting and paying off loans, and closing the account.
Each action follows clear rules, for example- you can’t close the account unless your balance is zero and you’ve paid off any loan.
